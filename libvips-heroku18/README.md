# libvips on heroku 18

This uses platform libraries when we can. It builds to `/usr/src/vips` in the
container, so tar that up and send it off to s3 ready to deploy.

Put the libpdfium tarball generated by `../pdfium-heroku18` in this directory
before starting.

# Rebuild the image

	docker pull heroku/heroku:18

	docker run -it --rm heroku/heroku:18

	docker build -t libvips-heroku18 .

# TODO

- check that libvips is picking everything up, esp. orc

- pull the packaged tarball back out of the container by mounting /data
